			<abstract>The TIGER/Line Files are shapefiles and related database files (.dbf) that are an extract of selected geographic and cartographic information from the U.S. Census Bureau's Master Address File / Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing (MAF/TIGER) Database (MTDB).  The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line File is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation. The Rails Shapefile includes all features within the MTDB Super Class "Rail Features" distinguished where the MAF/TIGER Feature Classification Code (MTFCC) for the feature in MTDB tha begin with "R".  This includes main lines such as spur lines, rail yards, mass transit rail lines such as carlines, streetcar track, monorail or other mass transit rail and special purpose rail lines such as cog rail lines, incline rail lines and trams.  
</abstract>
			<purpose>In order for others to use the information in the Census MAF/TIGER database in a geographic information system (GIS) or for other geographic applications, the Census Bureau releases to the public extracts of the database in the form of TIGER/Line Shapefiles.</purpose>

		<logic>There may be some inconsistencies in feature names along features.  An anomaly exists with the sporadic occurrence of road segments comprising a complete chain with different MAF/TIGER Feature Census Class Code (MTFCC) values assigned.  This problem could affect applications that use the MTFCC values for network analysis, routing, or for assigning symbology to a feature when creating a map.
The Census Bureau performed automated tests to ensure logical consistency and limits of shapefiles.  Node/geometry and topology relationships are collected or generated to satisfy topological edit requirements.  These requirements include:
(1) Complete chains must begin and end at nodes.
(2) Complete chains must connect to each other at nodes.
(3) Complete chains do not extend through nodes.
(4) Left and right polygons are defined for each complete chain element and are consistent throughout the extract process.
(5) The chains representing the limits of the files are free of gaps.</logic>

			<horizpa>
				<horizpar>The Census Bureau uses Global Positioning System (GPS) coordinates at road centerline intersections to evaluate the horizontal spatial accuracy of source files that may be used to realign road features in the MAF/TIGER database and test the horizontal spatial accuracy of the road features in the TIGER/Line Shapefiles.  The test compares a survey-grade GPS coordinate to its associated road centerline intersection in the TIGER/Line Shapefiles.  The test is based on an independent collection of GPS coordinates for a random sample of road intersections from a centerline file that meet certain criteria.  The points are referred to as the sample points and are gathered through a private contractor working for the Census Bureau.  Since the collection method uses survey-quality GPS-based field techniques, the resulting control points are considered 'ground truth' against which the TIGER road centerline intersection coordinates are compared.  The distances between the coordinates are calculated and the Census Bureau determines the Circular Error 95% (CE95).  That is, the accuracy of the file in meters with 95% confidence.  The CE95 can be calculated from the mean and standard deviation by using the formula: mean of differences plus (2.65 times the standard deviation).  CE95 results reported for each file tested are determined using a spreadsheet with embedded statistical formula.  The use and applicability of the spreadsheet and its embedded formula have been verified by Census Bureau statisticians.  The basis of the calculation is the use of the root mean square error (RMSE).  This is the method as stated in the U.S. Government's Federal Geographic Data Committee Standard FGDC-STD-007.3-1998, Geospatial Positioning Accuracy Standards.  Part 3: National Standard for Spatial Data Accuracy.  The results of using this measure of accuracy are in compliance with Federal Spatial Data requirements.  In terms of the Census Bureau application, the dataset coordinate values are those taken from the centerline file and the coordinate values from an independent source of higher accuracy are those acquired through the Census Bureau's contractor.  Please note that the horizontal spatial accuracy, where reported, refers only to the realigned road features identified as matched to the positionally accurate source file with that accuracy.  It is not the spatial accuracy of the TIGER/Line Shapefile as a whole.</horizpar>
